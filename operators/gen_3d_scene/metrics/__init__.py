operators/gen_3d_scene/metrics/

Score a generated scene mesh, reading artifacts only.

The metrics are chosen to make mesh continuity measurable rather than a matter
of eyeballing a viewport. Three of them target the failure modes that
`funcs/points_to_mesh.py` exists to fix:

  * `boundary_edge_ratio` — share of edges used by exactly one face. Every hole,
    crack and serrated border contributes; a frame's outer rim sets an
    irreducible floor, so compare runs against each other rather than zero. This
    is the number that moves when the pinhole and all-four-corners fixes work.
  * `largest_component_face_ratio` — how much of the mesh hangs together as one
    surface. Fragmentation shows up here.
  * `stretch_p99` — 99th-percentile edge length over the median. Rises when
    stretched triangles bridge occlusion boundaries.

Usage:
