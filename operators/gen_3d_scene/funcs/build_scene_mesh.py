Assemble a whole WorldMirror prediction into one scene mesh.

`points_to_mesh` fixes continuity *within* a frame. This module fixes it
*across* frames. Upstream's `convert_predictions_to_glb_scene` adds each frame
as its own independent `Trimesh`, so a sixteen-frame flythrough of one room
yields sixteen complete, overlapping copies of that room. They z-fight, they
multiply the triangle count by the number of views, and every slight depth
disagreement between views shows up as a visible double surface.

Here the frames are merged incrementally instead. Frame 0 is meshed in full;
each later frame is reprojected into the frames already accepted and contributes
only the pixels that are genuinely new — the regions disoccluded by camera
motion. The kept region is then dilated by a couple of pixels so new geometry
overlaps the old rather than butting up against it, which is what would leave a
crack along the join.

Finally the result is rotated from OpenCV's y-down world into the y-up frame
glTF expects, so the exported GLB is upright in every engine.

Usage:

    mesh = build_scene_mesh(prediction)
    mesh.export("scene.glb")

    Mesh every frame of a prediction and merge them into one scene.

    Args:
        prediction: A `WorldMirrorModel.infer` result.
        valid: (S, H, W) bool validity per pixel. Computed with `scene_mask`
            when omitted.
        sky_masks: Passed through to `scene_mask` when `valid` is not given.
        max_offplane: Face-continuity threshold — see `points_to_mesh`.
        max_tilt: Normal-agreement threshold — see `points_to_mesh`.
        close_holes: Pinhole-closing radius — see `points_to_mesh`.
        min_component_faces: Floater removal threshold, applied per frame.
        dedup: Contribute only newly visible geometry from each frame after the
            first. Turning this off reproduces upstream's stacked sheets.
        dedup_tolerance: Relative depth agreement for "already covered".
        dedup_overlap_px: Seam overlap in pixels.
        frame_stride: Use every Nth frame. Consecutive video frames overlap
            almost completely, so a stride of 2–4 cuts cost with little loss.
        to_gltf_axes: Rotate the result into glTF's y-up convention.
        return_intermediate: Return a dict of named stages instead of the mesh.

    Returns:
        A single `trimesh.Trimesh`, or — when `return_intermediate` is set — a
        dict with keys `mesh`, `per_frame_faces`, `frames_used` and `valid`.
