operators/gen_3d_scene/funcs/scene_mask.py

Decide which pixels of a WorldMirror prediction carry usable geometry.

Deliberately permissive. Upstream's `create_filter_mask` conflates "is this
pixel's position meaningful?" with "does this pixel sit on a discontinuity?" and
answers both by deleting the pixel. The second is what perforates the mesh, since
a discontinuity belongs to the boundary between two pixels rather than to either
one. `points_to_mesh` handles it there, on the faces, so this module answers only
the first question. Versus upstream:

  * No edge masks. `depth_edge` and `normals_edge` 3x3 max-pool their result, so
    every flagged pixel took a halo of good surface with it.
  * No confidence percentile by default — deleting the bottom decile of every
    frame is a relative threshold on an absolute question. Kept as a knob.
  * Sky removal stays when a mask is supplied: sky genuinely has no depth.

Usage:
    from operators.gen_3d_scene.funcs.scene_mask import scene_mask
    masks = scene_mask(prediction, sky_masks=None)   # (S, H, W) bool

        sky_masks: (S, H, W) bool where True means *non-sky*, matching
