operators/gen_3d_scene/funcs/points_to_mesh.py

Turn one frame's pointmap into a triangle mesh — the "面片" step.

Every pixel becomes a vertex and neighbouring pixels are stitched into quads, as
upstream also does. What differs is which faces survive.

Upstream (`create_image_mesh` driven by `infer.py::create_filter_mask`) deletes
the least-confident 10% of every frame, dilates its edge masks by 3x3, then keeps
a quad only when all four corners survived. Each step erodes further, so real
surfaces come out perforated — while the stretched triangles those filters were
aiming at largely survive anyway, because the edge masks are combined with `&`
and a pixel is dropped only when it trips both detectors at once.

This module keeps a vertex whenever its geometry is representable (finite,
positive depth) and enforces continuity per face instead:

  * Faces are culled on their own three edges, so the cut lands exactly on the
    occlusion boundary with no halo, and three valid corners still make a
    triangle.
  * An edge is continuous when both ends lie on the tangent plane implied by the
    other's normal. That residual is zero on a plane at any viewing angle, so a
    road receding to the horizon stays solid however steep its depth gradient;
    across an occlusion boundary the far point misses by hundreds of footprints.
    Depth difference alone cannot make that distinction — a grazing surface and
    an occluding edge look identical locally.
  * Faces must also agree with the normals they inherit. The depth head blurs an
    occlusion boundary into a ramp several pixels wide, so every individual step
    passes the edge test; the resulting sheet still betrays itself by lying
    edge-on to the surfaces it connects.
  * Pinholes are closed before meshing, and quads split along their shorter
    diagonal so the split follows slanted surfaces instead of cutting across.

            `normals`. `None` disables it.
        close_holes: Radius of the pinhole-closing pass. 0 disables it.
