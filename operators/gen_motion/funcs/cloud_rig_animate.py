"""
operators/gen_motion/funcs/cloud_rig_animate.py

Cloud rigging + animation, for the TokenHub / Tripo backend.

Separate from `rig_character` and `generate_motion` because the pipeline shape
differs. The local stack splits the work three ways — Puppeteer predicts a
skeleton, MoMask generates a BVH clip, a Blender pass retargets one onto the
other. The cloud stack has no intermediate BVH and no mapping file:
`tripo-3d-rigging` returns a rigged mesh and `tripo-3d-animation` retargets a
preset clip onto the skeleton that same task produced.

API constraints these helpers encode:

  * The mesh goes in as a URL. The endpoints download it themselves; this
    gateway has no upload endpoint and rejects `data:` URIs.
  * Animation chains off the rigging *task id*, not the rigged file or its URL.
    The skeleton lives server-side against that task and expires after 24 hours.
  * `spec="mixamo"` cannot be animated. Rigging for animation must use
    `spec="tripo"`; mixamo output is for DCC import only.
  * Motion comes from a fixed preset library, not from a text description.
