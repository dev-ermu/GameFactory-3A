"""Register assembly routing strategies and expose code-asset templates.

``routing`` selects composed, nested or surface strategies. ``compose``
builds specs; ``assembly`` resolves attachments. Domain templates provide
rigid assemblies and measured human equipment.

Importing this package registers the built-in strategies. ``fit_wearable``
loads its optional Blender bridge only when called.
