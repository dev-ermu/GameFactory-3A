tests/test_motion_cloud.py

Integration test for the cloud rigging + animation chain
(TokenHub / Tripo), the drop-in replacement for Puppeteer + MoMask.

Two modes, and the difference matters:

  --stub  (default)  No network, no key, no credits. Exercises the plumbing:
                     task parsing, artifact paths, meta.json, the operator's
                     branch logic. This is what CI runs.

  --real             Real API calls against tokenhub.tencentmaas.com. Costs
                     credits and needs TOKENHUB_API_KEY plus post-pay billing
                     enabled at console.cloud.tencent.com/tokenhub/inference.

THE MESH GOES IN AS A URL. These endpoints download the mesh themselves, the
gateway has no upload endpoint, and a `data:` URI is accepted by /submit and then
fails in the worker with FailedOperation.DownloadError. So `--real` needs
`--mesh-url <public link>`; a local path alone cannot be submitted, and the test
says so rather than failing inside a billed call.

Results are written as local files and reviewed locally: `rig_viewer.html` beside
them reads both GLB and FBX and reports the bone count, the clips, and any bone
bound to nothing.

Usage:
    python tests/test_motion_cloud.py                          # stub, no cost
    TOKENHUB_API_KEY=sk-... python tests/test_motion_cloud.py --real \
        --mesh-url https://example.com/tpose_body_lo.glb --out-format fbx
