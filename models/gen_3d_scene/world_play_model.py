"""
WorldPlayModel — wraps Hunyuan WorldPlay, an action-conditioned video world
model. A reference image, a text prompt and a camera trajectory go in; a
sequence of frames flying through the described world comes out.

Reference: https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HY-WorldPlay
Weights:   tencent/HY-WorldPlay + tencent/HunyuanVideo-1.5

Prerequisites — this wrapper drives the upstream repo in place rather than
vendoring it, because it carries its own large dependency set (diffusers 0.35,
Qwen2.5-VL, ByT5, SigLIP) that conflicts with the geometry stack. Install it
into its own environment.

  1. Clone HY-WorldPlay and point `$HY_WORLDPLAY_REPO` at it (or pass
     `repo_path=`), then install its `requirements.txt`.
  2. Fetch the weights. Upstream's `download_models.py` takes all of
     tencent/HY-WorldPlay, which is 189 GB of five model variants; only the one
     `action_ckpt` names is ever loaded, so prefer `allow_patterns`. With the
     base model, the Qwen2.5-VL text encoder and the rest it comes to ~90 GB.
  3. The vision encoder is the one awkward piece. Upstream takes it from the
     gated `black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Redux-dev`, but what the pipeline actually
     wants is plain `google/siglip-so400m-patch14-384`, which is not gated — the
     hardcoded `vision_states_dim=1152` and `vision_num_semantic_tokens=729` are
     that model's hidden size and its 27x27 patch grid. Save its vision tower as
     `<model_path>/vision_encoder/siglip/image_encoder` and the matching
     `SiglipImageProcessor` as `.../feature_extractor`.

480p needs ~40 GB of VRAM, less with `offloading=True`.

The frames it produces are the input to `WorldMirrorModel`, which turns them
into geometry. That two-stage split is why this model returns PIL frames rather
than a video file.

Usage — `action_ckpt` is a Hub reference fetched on first use, but `model_path`
has to be the assembled directory from step 3; see `check_model_path`:

    from models.gen_3d_scene import WorldPlayModel
    model = WorldPlayModel(
        model_path=os.environ["WORLDPLAY_CKPT"],
        action_ckpt="tencent/HY-WorldPlay/ar_distilled_action_model"
                    "/diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors",
        few_step=True,
    )
    frames = model.infer(image, prompt="a misty pine forest", pose="w-8, right-4")
