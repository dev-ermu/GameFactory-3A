"""
This sub-package contains *tool* models — utility / auxiliary models that
support the main generation pipelines but are not themselves the primary
content generator. Examples:

- depth estimation (DepthAnything)
- foreground segmentation / background removal (RMBG-1.4, SAM, ...)
- matting / alpha refinement
- keypoint / pose detection helpers

All tool models inherit from `BaseToolModel` (see `base.py`) so they share a
consistent constructor, device handling, and `__call__` / `infer` API.

The concrete wrappers are resolved lazily, so importing this package stays cheap
and pulls in only the backend you actually name. Eagerly re-exporting them would
drag `transformers` and `torchvision` into every caller, including ones that only
want a small ONNX model.
